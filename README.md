# siege-engine-docs

The Siege Engine is an MMO Game Engine targetting the Vulkan API and written in the
Rust language.

This crate is overview documentation only. For API level documentation, see the individual
repositories themselves, and/or their rust documentation.

## Example

The screenshot above is from a game being developed using the Siege Engine.

An example usage of the engine is forthcoming. In the meantime, there is an example inside of
the `siege-render` crate that could prove useful for getting started.
