This crate is documentation/overview only.

## News

I am starting to open-source the Siege Engine, an MMO Game Engine targeting the Vulkan API
written in the Rust language.

The main crates are (not yet published as of this writing):

* *siege-client*: A graphical game client, the biggest component.
* *siege-server*: A skeleton of a game server.
* *siege-net*: A network protocol connecting the two.
